<h4 id="huebridge-class">HueBridge Class</h4>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the <code>[HueBridge]</code> class. Use this to get an APIKey/username from your bridge so you can get and set light data with it using the <code>[HueLight]</code> class later.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the IP address of your Bridge. The <code>[HueBridge]</code> class contains a static method (this means you can call it without instantiating the class) called <code>.FindHueBridge()</code>.</li>
<li>Run</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-powershell"> [HueBridge]::FindHueBridge()
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Your computer will perform a search. The search is synchronous (means you need to wait for it to complete) and takes about 15-20 seconds to finish. The method finds all UPnP devices described as &quot;Hue&quot; on your LAN (Subnet) and returns those as a list, giving you the IP of your bridge. One might argue this should happen by default, after all, the Hue Bridge IP address may change in a DHCP network. Two reasons why I don&#39;t do this automagically: 1. Who says this is the only Hue Bridge in the network? 2. The method call is a blocking action and I&#39;ve not tried to get PowerShell to do stuff asynchronously with a callback yet.</li>
<li><p>Instantiate a <code>[HueBridge]</code> class using your discovered (or known) Bridge IP address. Substitue your own bridge&#39;s IP address obviously.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-powershell">$Bridge = [HueBridge]::New(&#39;192.168.1.12&#39;)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Get the properties of the Bridge object.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-powershell">$Bridge
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>You&#39;ll see just the IP address property for now.</li>
</ol>
